# Advent of Code 2022

## Goal
This repo contains my solutions for the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. I've become more familiar with using Rust within embedded environments through my work, but am still a novice with Rust's data handling libraries. I'm using AoC 2022 as a chance to better learn this aspect of the language, and hopefully be more consistent than AoC 2021 :).

## Usage
This project is built and run with Cargo. You can build the project with the following command:
```bash
cargo build
```
You can run the project for a specific day with the following command:
```bash
cargo run ${problem_day}
```
